This chapter describes the history of hacking and password security in \prettyref{sec:historicOverview}. Hacking developed in the early 20$^{th}$ century and became more important over time. \prettyref{sec:related} introduces some work about security and safe encryption algorithms. 
The Oxford English Dictionary appeared around 1200 and meant to 'cut with heavy blows in an irregular or random fashion'. The word 'hack' was first used for fussing with machines in the M.I.T. in April 1955.

\section{Historical Overview}
\label{sec:historicOverview}

The following historical overview of computer security hacker history covers some important events in the development of hacking and cracking. It started in 1932 by the polish cryptologists Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy RÃ³zycki who broke the Enigma machine code. The Enigma machine is a electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine that was used in the second world war in order to encrypt the information exchange of the german military. Despite permanent improvement of the encryption algorithm, were the allies able to encrypt nearly every message. 
Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman and Harold Keen together developed the Turing-Welchman-Bombe based on the work of Rejewski et al. Since the Enigma uses a reliably small key space, it was possible to brute force the possibilities.
